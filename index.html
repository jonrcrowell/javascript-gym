      <h1>Check the console.</h1>
      <p>Add as many javascript files as you want in the exercises folder.</p>
      <p>
        Simply update the src attribute in the script tag on the body of the
        index.html file to reference whatever exercise you are working on.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach allows you to work on a focused exercise without having to
        delete or comment out previous exercises.
